    # This test will fail and we won't accept that! For Homebrew/homebrew-core
    # this will need to be a test that verifies the functionality of the
    # software. Run the test with `brew test TwoPi`. Options passed
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.

    # The installed folder is not in the path, so use the entire path to any
    # executables being tested: `system "#{bin}/program", "do", "something"`.
