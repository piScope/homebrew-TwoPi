#### Memo for myself... Step to release a new version

   #
   #  Update TwoPi

   1) push changes to test branch
   2) once it passes the test, merge it to master
   3) make a pre-release 
   
   #  call brew bump-formula-pr and copy URL
   #  run the following command locally.
   4) $ brew  bump-formula-pr -f -d -v --no-fork  --no-browse --no-audit --url <URL>  piscope/twopi/<FORMULA>

   # This will create PR and Action will run to make a bottle in GitHub.
   5)  Trigger an action for publishing the reelase. This is done by assigning pr-pull-twopi label to the PR.

   
   Then update formula
```
